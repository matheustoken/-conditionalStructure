# Java Challenge: Income Tax Calculation

## Description
This challenge involves creating a Java program to calculate the income tax a person needs to pay based on the following rules:

### Tax Rules:

#### Salary Tax:
- Monthly salary below 3000: Exempt
- Monthly salary from 3000 to 5000 (exclusive): 10%
- Monthly salary of 5000 or more: 20%

#### Service Income Tax:
- Income earned from services is taxed at 15%.

#### Capital Gains Tax:
- Income from capital gains (e.g., real estate, stocks) is taxed at 20%.

### Deductions:
- The person can deduct up to 30% of their gross tax with medical or educational expenses.
- If medical and educational expenses are less than 30% of the gross tax, only the actual expense amount can be deducted.

## Objective:
Develop a Java program that:
- Reads the following inputs:
  - Annual income from salary.
  - Annual income from services.
  - Annual income from capital gains.
  - Annual medical and educational expenses.
- Calculates and generates an income tax report based on the rules provided.
